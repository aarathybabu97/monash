This file is just a dummy file 
required for the Rmd template. You can safely delete this file. 

To get started, have a look at other Rmd files.

If you named your file, `index.Rmd`, `00-abstract.Rmd`, `00-acknowledge.Rmd`, `00-copyright.Rmd`, `00-declaration.Rmd`, `00-preface.Rmd` `01-chap1.Rmd `, `02-chap2.Rmd` or `A-appA.Rmd`, it may have overwritten the other necessary files so it will be better to redo it and rename your file to something else.
